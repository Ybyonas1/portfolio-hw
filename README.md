## Description
In this assignment we were instructed to update our portfolio. I know this may seem like a rough copy, but I do plan on making continuous edits to improve the porfolio of course.

## Installation
Nothing major was installed except a few images that I added to the portfolio.

## Visuals
Although it may seem very plain, I am hoping I will be able to come back and provide a more tweaks to the portfolio.

The following is a screenshot of the portfolio.
